# debian-repo-scrape

debian-repo-scrape contains utilities for verifying the integrity of a debian repository and scrape its contents.

# TODO:
- Increase test coverage
- Create documentation
- Support flat debian repositories (if I ever get to see one in the wild that legitimates the need for support)
